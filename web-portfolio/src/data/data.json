            "description": "EPData. is a work in progress free web tool that allows architects and other construction professionals to track and visualize embodied carbon emissions of various construction material options. There is increasing demand in the construction industry to source sustainable materials, calculate embodied carbon emissions, and conduct whole life cycle analysis of buildings. EPDs have emerged as one of the most popular ways to measure the carbon footprint and global warming potential of building materials. EPD stands for Environmental Product Declaration. An EPD is a formal document that contains information about the environmental impact and performance of a product. Product manufacturers have increasingly used and produced EPDs because they conform to international standards and are used to demonstrate compliance."

The project advocates for the rights of the Nile by claiming that current planning and construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam (GERD), which is the next mega infrastructure to be built, is an act of Ecocide."

Research, spatial analysis, and visualization work into the negative environmental and socio-economic impacts the dam will have in the region are conducted alongside a womenâ€™s rights NGO, FESO. This work is done in tandem with on site fieldwork with communities affected by the dam."

The agricultural industry in Russia aims to sustain a large population as Putin seeks to make the country one of the largest agricultural producers in the world with ideas of geopolitical expansion. This results in intensive chemical fertilizer and irrigation use, exhausting the soil and increasing fossil fuel consumption. Vast monocultures of crops contribute to biodiversity loss and lack of resilience to climate change."
